DIG4104 Project 1


//comments from class

Love the layout, style and colors… If you are trying to get technical, when you hover, sometimes the experience years gets stuck. Love it thought

Too amazing, should be teaching this course, not taking it
…..do you offer Tutoring? James-Costello@hotmail.com

Very well done, maybe add a transition to the mouse over if possible.

Weird when hovering over words in circles, flickering words. looks good

Like your color choices, maybe a key on for the pie charts so we know what each color means; need some layout editing for the hover text where it goes onto the circles at places. Civil Engineering what? 

really nice layout and color choices. the hover states don’t go back on the “emerging” area

i dig the design a lot and the colors go really well together. It would be really cool if you could make the fill of the rings animate to how full they go. Also, it seems to glitch the name a lot when you hover over the name

Cool layout! I really like your hover states. Maybe more description of what the bars represent in the experience section? 

Nice layout. I like the hover effects you have going on in your pie charts

It’s responsive, go you! The design is nice. The hover change in words is kind of abrupt though, I would consider changing that.

Very nice layout and good job with the responsiveness and active hover states.  I like the way your circle graphs are laid out and set up.  I don’t have anything for you sorry :(  good job

I really like this design good work make it your own. The only input I could give would be to add animations on the circles.

The brand is very well put together, everything looks cohesive and I like that the circles show your years of experience

Excellent way of representing your proficiencies. The color choices play well with each other, and great choice of typography. The responsiveness is sweet! 

Adorable colors, typography, and graphics! The hover state on the donut charts feel rough. Maybe animate tooltips/popovers in?

It looks so good! Hover state does need a little work.

Your colors are so chill, tell us more about yourself :)

love the look. could use some spacing for each section. info is too compact. 

i love the header illustrations it makes your image so one of a kind. i like the play on web designer AND civil engineer. use of term emerging was brilliant great font choices too and colors mesh so well together

it might not be necessary to express hierarchy of proficiency with size, color, and amount of fill on the circle. not all three. perhaps make smaller?

I really like what you have going on here! you should indicate somewhere that your charts have more information on hover!

Looks super great I guess I should really get started on this project 

//notes in class
scale down a little, play with the sizes

clarity of the visualization

remove the cell phone number (business phone number would be fine)

make it harder to scan the email; make the @ sign an image or write it out
